Welcome to my blog. This is where I'll share thoughts on machine learning, mathematics, and the projects I'm building.

## What to expect

I'm planning to write about:

- **Technical deep-dives**: Breaking down ML concepts and implementations
- **Project updates**: What I'm building and lessons learned
- **Paper notes**: Summaries and thoughts on interesting research

## A quick math example

Here's the softmax function, which I'll probably reference a lot:

$$\text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_{j} e^{x_j}}$$

Stay tuned for more.
